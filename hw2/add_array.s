	# See the declaration in add_array.h
	# This function takes two parameters:
	#   -- an array (i.e. a 64-bit pointer in the %rdi register)
	#   -- the size of the array (i.e. a 32-bit integer in
	#      the %esi register.
	# It returns the sum of the elements of the array. The return
	# value, being 32 bits, must be placed in the %eax register.
	
_add_array:

	# Note: You can overwrite the 64-bit registers %rax, %rcx, %rdx, %r8,
	# %r9, %r10, %r11 (as well as their 32-bit halves, %eax, %ecx,
	# %edx, %r8d, %r9d, %r10d, %r11d) as you like. These are the
	# "caller-saved" registers.

	# hint: to access a[i], use scaled indexed addressing
	# mode: "(base_reg,index_reg,scale)" -- see page 180 of Bryant & O'Hallaron
	# If the base_reg is a 64-bit register (e.g. %rdi holding the address of
	# the array), then the index_reg (e.g. holding i) must also be a 64-bit
	# register.
